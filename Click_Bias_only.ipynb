       "      <th>Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\n\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\n\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\n\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\n\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\n\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\n\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\n\\nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer</th>\n",

       "      <th>President Trump, right, with Rep. Robert Lighthizer ( REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\\n\\n\"Fake news\" is now part of the American vernacular, and wordsmiths have Donald Trump to thank.\\n\\nPresident Trump recently handed out the 2017 \"Fake News Awards\" for the 11 most irresponsible examples of reporting. And the headlines, ranging from ice cream to pecan pie, bordered on—if not crossed—the ridiculous. Trump's \"favorite\" media outlet, CNN, garnered four of the awards.\\n\\nBut long before last week's awards, Donald Trump was calling out those who just plain didn't get the story straight, even on the campaign trail. And his boldness resonated with voters, says Stephen E. Strang, author of the best-selling book, God and Donald Trump.\\n\\nStrang, who was a guest on Fox &amp; Friends this past Sunday, said that when then-candidate Trump began responding to his critics at all hours of the day and night on Twitter, he surprised and embarrassed a lot of his detractors, tweeting strongly worded comments no one had expected.\\n\\n\"He had already waged highly publicized verbal battles with Meryl Streep and other celebrities such as Rosie O'Donnell and Oprah Winfrey, but this would be an altogether different kind of war,\" Strang wrote. \"With a level of technical savvy uncommon for a man of his generation, Trump was able to counterattack within minutes whenever his opponents made scurrilous charges against him. This was something new, and it delighted his fans and the public at large, even as it infuriated the increasingly volatile resistance.\\n\\n\"Before long, Trump was a serial tweeter, and he provided the media with some riveting sound bites,\" he continued. \"Not everyone, of course, was thrilled by this new development. Liberal news organizations compiled exhaustive catalogs of Trump's tweets to show how insensitive, ignorant and wrong-headed he could be. But they couldn't ignore them, and they followed his tweets faithfully, hoping to catch him in some word or deed that would be his undoing.\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nStrang fully acknowledges that some of Trump's comments were tactless and crude, often attacking his detractors with salty schoolyard taunts.\\n\\n\"But Trump's use of Twitter gave him a way around the mainstream media and his political opponents who had been getting free access to the media and were able to insult and demean him with impunity,\" Strang wrote. \"Suddenly, those same people were being held accountable in real time, and news hawks on both sides didn't want to miss a word of it.\\n\\n\"Trump hasn't slowed his Twitter storm since moving into the White House,\" the author added. \"At one point, he had said there would have been 'ZERO chance of winning WH' if he had relied on the 'Fake News' being churned out by the mainstream media. But his candid and unfiltered Twitter feeds helped turn the tables on his foes.\"\\n\\nStrang is an award-winning journalist and successful businessman who began his career as a newspaper reporter at the Orlando Sentinel. He later founded a Christian publishing house and media company while interviewing and writing about nearly every Christian leader in the country over the past four decades.\\n\\nFor more information on God and Donald Trump, visit GodandDonaldTrump.com and view the book's video.

Candidate Donald Trump highlighted the crime victims of illegal aliens, including giving them a platform at the Republican convention. In his acceptance speech for the presidency at the convention he said:\\n\\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.\\n\\nHere are the parents Trump mentioned, Jamiel Shaw Sr., Mary Ann Mendoza and Sabine Durden, with pictures of their lost sons below:\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump is working to build the wall and keep out dangerous foreigners to protect the American people.

Judge Leibovitz is apparently on a mission to make a mockery of justice. However, Chief Judge Robert Morin is named at the end of the defendants’ list, which sounds like more good news. (I do not know Judge Morin’s history well enough to judge him.)\\n\\nJudge Leibovitz was so prejudiced in her conduct during the trial that she banned all officers of the court and all witnesses from ever so much as uttering the phrases “Black Bloc” or “ANTIFA” in her courtroom. That order made it impossible for the prosecution to make its case.\\n\\nImagine if during the late John Gotti’s various federal trials for racketeering and murder, the judges had forbidden the prosecution from ever uttering “the Mafia,” “Cosa Nostra,” “organized crime,” “Gambino crime family,” “the Don,” or any terms like them? The fix would be in, just as much as if Gotti’s people had bribed a juror.\\n\\nU.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, and Assistant USAs Jennifer A. Kerkhoff and Rizwan Qureshi, the prosecutors from the Liebovitz trial responded on January 18 with defiance.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT’S NOTICE OF INTENT TO PROCEED …. On January 20, 2017, several hundred people met in and around Logan Circle in Washington, D.C., to participate in an anti-capitalist march without a parade permit. This unpermitted anti-capitalist march was advertised and planned, with instructions for participants to wear black clothing In addition, the term “black bloc” was used by organizers in planning meetings. The planned use of a black bloc is significant in this case. The term “black bloc” refers to a tactic, not a particular group or organization, and is frequently used when participants within the larger black-bloc group intend to commit violence or destruction of property On January 20, 2017, several hundred people participated in a black bloc as part of the unpermitted anti-capitalist march that started in Logan Circle and moved through downtown DC. At or about 10:19 AM on January 20, 2017, a black bloc moved south from Logan Circle on 13th Street NW. Within minutes of leaving Logan Circle, individuals participating in the black bloc\\n\\nbegan to destroy or damage public and private property. The black bloc continued moving through the streets of the District of Columbia for approximately sixteen (16) blocks for more than thirty (30) minutes, while participants in the black bloc continued to destroy or damage property as the group moved. It was a riot. At approximately 10:52 AM on January 20, 2017, after law enforcement formed a police line in the area of 12th and L Streets NW, approximately 200 members of the black bloc charged the police line that was attempting to contain the black bloc in the area of 12th and L Streets NW, Washington, D.C. Although some black bloc participants were able to break through the police line, law enforcement was ultimately able to contain what remained of the black bloc….\\n\\nSee Prosecutors proceed against 59 inauguration rioters, charges against 129 dropped, TakingInIssues.com, January 18, 2018.\\n\\nPreviously, on this case, at VDARE.com:\\n\\nThe names of the 59 remaining defendants, including those set for trial on March 5, 2018, including their case numbers and trial dates, respectively, follow:</th>\n",

       "      <th>Howard Kurtz is the media critic for FOX News. He is fair in his assessment of the media which has gone over the edge in its coverage of Trump.\\n\\nThe Hollywood reporter has excerpted part of Kurtz’s new book on the subject:\\n\\nHow “Trump Trauma” Is Crippling the News Media (Guest Column)\\n\\nOn Jan. 8, 2017, days before Donald Trump was to assume the crushing burdens of the presidency, he faced a very different kind of problem: Meryl Streep.\\n\\nThe iconic actress slammed him in her speech accepting the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, attacking him for, among other things, having allegedly mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the campaign. The next morning, Hope Hicks, the president’s loyal young assistant who was almost always by Trump’s side, pulled out her phone to play footage of Kellyanne Conway on the CNN and Fox morning shows.\\n\\nKellyanne said that charge had been repeatedly refuted and added that if Streep were so concerned about the rights of the disabled, she should have spoken out about a disabled boy who had been badly beaten by young thugs shouting anti-Trump epithets in a video that had been posted on Facebook. Trump loved that answer and started venting about his media coverage.\\n\\nHicks retreated to a nearby desk, where she spoke to Times reporter Patrick Healy. He had called Trump’s cellphone during the Globes and then quoted the president-elect as saying he wasn’t surprised by criticisms from “liberal movie people.” Hicks took Healy to task.\\n\\nThe worst part about the media is that they aren’t even trying to hide their bias anymore.</th>\n",

       "      <th>Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\n\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\n\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\n\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\n\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\n\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\n\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\n\\nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer</th>\n",
